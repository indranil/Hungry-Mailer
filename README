HUNGRY MAILER v0.7
==================

Thank you for using Hungry Mailer.

To use hungry mailer, use this as the form :

<form action="hungry_mailer.php" method="POST">

Either you can open up the code file and put in the receiver email address, the subject and the redirect to, or use the following three input fields to set them on a per-form basis.

To set them within the form, use the following elements :
--- <input type="hidden" name="to" value="email@address.com">
--- <input type="hidden" name="subject" value="Subject goes here">
--- <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="http://redirect.to/here/">
And that's that.

Enjoy! :)
