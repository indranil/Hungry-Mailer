Thank you for getting Hungry Mailer.

To use hungry mailer, use this as the form :

<form action="hungry_mailer.php" method="POST">

Either you can open up the code file and put in the receiver email address and the subject, or use the following two input fields to set them on a per-form basis.

To set them within the form, use the following elements :
--- <input type="hidden" name="to" value="email@address.com">
--- <input type="hidden" name="subject" value="Subject goes here">
And that's that.

Enjoy! :)
